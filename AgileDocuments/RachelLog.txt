  Created intial backlog chart and Sprint 1 backlog. Will assign Sprint 1 assignments and turn in Checkpoint 1 to ecampus by 8PM.
  Planning to start MTG2 tomorrow and set up working environment. No issues.

  Have been exploring different graphics options. Set up working environment. Will be building game screen tomorrow. 
  Removed the htm file for simplicity and ease for everyone to edit the excel file. No impediments.

  Built the game screen successfully. The program will initially set up a game screen with 4 seeds per pot. Having troubles 
  finding a way to "redraw" or "update" the screen. JComponents do not allow layering and therefore we would need to 
  create a new gameSreen object every time a move is made, which seems very inneficient as opposed to just redrawing the pieces.
  Will look more into this tomorrow, However this functionality is not exactly a part of Sprint 1, would just be more
  convenient to figure this out now, so priority will be put on the Game Manager.

  UPDATE: Found solution, will be using LayeredPanes to edit seeds without editing entire board.
  Useful links I have found pertaining to graphics: 
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/layeredpane.html
      https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JLayeredPane.html
  Outlined the GameManager and the functions needed for this. Still working on the multi-line seeds showing. Began working on
  Mouse Events for the GameScreen. Will be camping on 03/16/2017-03/18/2017 aka not much cell service.
  Will Update the Doxygen with new specifications when I am set in stone as to the design of the gameScreen. (Just double checking
  that what I have will take care of everything we need for the project so that we won't need to alter later)
